<p>Autumn Moonlightâ€”<br>a worm digs silently<br>into the chestnut.</p>

<p>Do your worst, old frost<br>you can no longer wound me...<br>last chrysanthemum!</p>

<p>Watching, I wonder<br>what poet could put down his<br>quill... a pluperfect moon!</p>

<p>A white swan swimming...<br>parting with her unmoved breast<br>cherry-petaled pond</p>

<p>Angry I strode home...<br>but stopping in my garden<br>calm old willow-tree</p>

<p>Deepen, drop, and die<br>many-hued chrysanthemums...<br>one black earth for all</p>

<p>In the farther field<br>a scarecrow kept me<br>company...<br>walking as I walked</p>

<p>Defeated in the fray<br>by bigger battlers for love...<br>tom-cat seeks a mouse</p>

<p>Yellow evening sun...<br>long shadow of the scarecrow<br>reaches to the road</p>

<p>Pretty butterflies...<br>be careful of pine-needle points<br>in this gusty wind!</p>

<p>Tea-water, tired<br>waiting while we watched the snow...<br>froze itself a hat</p>

<p>Crossing it alone<br>in cold moonlight... the brittle<br>bridge echoes my footsteps</p>

<p>Many solemn night<br>blond moon, we stand<br>and marvel...<br>sleeping our noons away</p>

<p>Chilling autumn rain...<br>the moon, too bright for showers,<br>slips from their fingers</p>

<p>White-moth, flutter off:<br>fly back into my breast now<br>quickly, my own soul!</p>

<p>My shadow path<br>I&#39;ve swept all day<br>and now... oh no!<br>Camellia-shower!</p>
